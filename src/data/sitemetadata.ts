This helps maintain proper posture, relieve back pain and increase stability and balance.",

This is particularly beneficial during pregnancy as proper breathing can help reduce anxiety, control stress and provide more energy.",
        "Reducing stress and anxiety: The practice of yoga involves deep relaxation and meditation techniques, which help calm the mind and reduce stress and anxiety associated with pregnancy. This creates a state of mental tranquility, allowing the mother-to-be to connect with her body and her baby in a fuller and more serene way.",
        "Preparation for childbirth: Yoga for pregnant women can help in the physical and emotional preparation for childbirth. Exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor and open the pelvic region can contribute to a smoother delivery and facilitate postpartum recovery.",
        "Connection with the baby: The practice of yoga provides moments of deep connection between mother and baby. Through concentration on breathing and gentle exercises, the mother-to-be can tune in to the baby's sensations and movements, strengthening the emotional bond even before the birth.",
        "It is important to stress that the practice of yoga during pregnancy must be guided by a qualified professional and adapted to the individual needs of each pregnant woman. It is recommended that pregnant women consult their doctor before beginning any exercise programme during pregnancy.",
        "Yoga for pregnant women offers a valuable opportunity for self-care, balance and connection with the body and the baby, preparing the woman to experience this unique moment of motherhood in a fuller and more conscious way."
